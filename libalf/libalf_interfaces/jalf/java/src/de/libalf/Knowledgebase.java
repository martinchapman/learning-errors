/**
 * <p>
 * A knowledgebase manages the information used during the learning process. It
 * stores information about the membership of words <em>w</em> with respect to a
 * formal language <em>L</em>. A word is a sequence of integers represented as
 * an integer array. The knowledgebase stores either {@link Acceptance#ACCEPT}
 * or {@link Acceptance#REJECT} depending on whether <em>w</em> belongs to
 * <em>L</em> or not. If this information is not yet available, the word is
 * marked as {@link Acceptance#UNKNOWN}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each {@link LearningAlgorithm} is associated with a knowledgebase and
 * retrieves its information exclusively this particular knowledgebase. However,
 * a knowledgebase can be an information source for many learning algorithms
 * simultaneously.<br>
 * <em>Note: Synchronization (e.g. via the Java sync facility) is not yet supported.</em>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the learning algorithm is able to ask <em>membership queries</em> - like
 * Angluin's algorithm (see {@link JNIAlgorithmAngluin}) -, the algorithm add the
 * words to the knowledgebase and marks them as {@link Acceptance#UNKNOWN}. Such
 * unknown words can then be retrieved via the
 * {@link Knowledgebase#getQueries()} -method. A query can be answered by
 * calling {@link Knowledgebase#add_knowledge(int[], boolean)} providing the
 * word and its information.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>This is a Java implementation of the <em>knowledgebase</em> C++ class.
 * All method calls are forwarded to the LibALF C++ library via the JNI
 * interface.</li>
 * <li>
 * This JavaDoc is only a rough overview. For a detailed documentation please
 * refer to the original LibALF C++ documentation.</li>
