/**
 * <p>
 * Root of all classes representing the JNI LibALF C++ objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each <code>JNIObject</code> stores a 64 bit variable (a <em>pointer</em>)
 * that points to memory location of the C++ object. Each <code>native</code>
 * method call on C++ objects via the JNI interface has to provide a pointer to
 * locate the object.<br>
 * The 64 bit variable allows the memory access on both 32 bit and 64 bit
 * systems.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is only the root class and should not be initialized. Each
 * subclass has to provide an <code>init</code> method that initializes a C++
 * object via the JNI interface and returns the memory address of the object.
 * This initialization can be performed in the constructor of the subclass.
 * </p>
