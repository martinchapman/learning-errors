/**
 * <p>
 * The root interface of all LibALF learning algorithms.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A class implementing the <code>LearningAlgorithm</code> interface provides
 * the code of the learning algorithm. Additionally, in LibALF a learning
 * algorithm is associated with:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An <em>alphabet</em> over which queries are conducted and conjectures are
 * built.</li>
 * <li>A <em>knowledge source</em>, given as a {@link Knowledgebase} object,
 * from which the learning algorithm obtains its information.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A <code>Knowledgebase</code> is used by both <em>offline</em> and
 * <em>online</em> learning algorithms. For offline learning algorithms it is
 * the only source of information. For online learning algorithms it acts as a
 * buffer between the learning algorithm and the teacher:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An learning algorithms requesting new information stores its queries in
 * the <code>Knowledgebase</code> and marks the words as
 * {@link Acceptance#UNKNOWN}.</li>
 * <li>The teacher obtains these queries by calling
 * {@link Knowledgebase#getQueries()} and can answer them one by one using
 * {@link Knowledgebase#add_knowledge(int[], boolean)}.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The learning is invoked by calling {@link LearningAlgorithm#advance()}. For
 * offline learning algorithms, where no interaction is necessary, the
 * <code>advance</code> method returns a {@link BasicAutomaton} as result of the
 * inference.<br>
 * Online learning algorithms may stop because either queries have to be
 * answered (then <code>advance</code> returns <code>null</code>), or because a
 * conjecture is ready. In the latter case a {@link BasicAutomaton} is returned.
 * Note that {@link LearningAlgorithm#conjecture_ready()} can also be used to
 * check whether <code>advance</code> has provided a new conjecture.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some learning algorithms support the undo of operations after they have been
 * synchronized to their associated <code>Knowledgebase</code>. If a learning
 * algorithm supports synchronization with a knowledge base, i.e.
 * {@link LearningAlgorithm#supports_sync()} returns <code>true</code>, it can
 * be synchronized by calling {@link LearningAlgorithm#sync_to_knowledgebase()}.
 * <br>
 * Undo operations can easily be performed by calling
 * {@link Knowledgebase#undo(int)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>This is a Java implementation of the <em>learning_algorithm</em> C++
 * class.</li>
 * <li>
 * This JavaDoc is only a rough overview. For a detailed documentation please
 * refer to the original LibALF C++ documentation.</li>
