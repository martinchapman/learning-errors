/*
 * This class demonstrates how to use online algorithms in libalf. In this
 * example, the user is queried for classified examples that are then used to
 * compute the final result.
 *
 * This program takes the alphabet size as the input and produces the conjecture
 * as the output by requesting the user to classify the queries/words computed
 * in the knowledgebase. As the first step, a knowledgebase is created.
 * The user is then required to provide information about the
 * alphabet size of the automaton. Once this information is obtained, a learning
 * algorithm is created by passing the type of algorithm, empty knowledgebase,
 * and the alphabet size as the parameters. The learning algorithm advances
 * iteratively, checking at every step, if enough information exists in the
 * knowledgebase to construct a conjecture. If there was no enough information
 * to compute a conjecture, a list of words (called queries) that are to be
 * classifed by the user is produced. The words are presented to the user for
 * classification and this information is added to the knowledgebase. When
 * during an advance, if a conjecture was computed, then it is presented to the
 * user to check its equivalence. If the conjecture was correct, the file
 * "output_online.dot" containing the code for the automaton is created.
 * However, if the conjecture is incorrect, then the user is prompted to provide
 * a counter example which is used in furthur construction of the conjecture. In
 * this demo, the ANGLUIN algorithm is used.
